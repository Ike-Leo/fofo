## Codebase Patterns
- Convex functions use `getAuthUserId(ctx)` for authentication
- Org-scoped queries always filter by `orgId`
- All mutations validate caller authorization before proceeding
- Use `v.id("tableName")` for foreign key references
- Include `createdAt: v.number()` on all records
- **PowerShell**: Use `-LiteralPath` when deleting files/folders with brackets like `[...slug]`.
- **Public API**: Located in `convex/public/*`. Queries accept `orgSlug`.
- **Storefront**: Located in `app/store`. Use `StoreHeader` and `StoreFooter`.
